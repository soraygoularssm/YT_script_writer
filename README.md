# AI-Powered YouTube Script Generator

This project leverages large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 Omni and Llama 3.1 8B (or any open-source LLM API) to generate complete, high-quality YouTube scripts. The tool is designed to help content creators streamline their workflow by providing AI-generated scripts with built-in features for enhanced scriptwriting.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Script Generation**: Utilize cutting-edge LLMs to generate scripts based on your input, topics, or themes.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for relevant content or ideas to include in your script.
- **Word Count and Character Count**: Automatically calculate the word and character count of your script to estimate its reading time and fit your time constraints.
